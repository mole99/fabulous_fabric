To build individual user designs, go into one of the directories and run the commands:

```
Commands:
 synth           ... Synthesize the user design
 pnr             ... Run Place and Route
 bitstream       ... Generate the bitstream
 clean           ... Delete all generated files
 help            ... Show this help message
```

To build all of them, run:

```
make build_all
```

To delete all generated files, run:

```
make clean_all
```

**Note:** To generate the bitstreams you need to `pip3 install fasm`.
